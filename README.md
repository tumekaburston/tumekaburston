### Hi there 👋

🤝 I believe that digital experience should be inclusive and accessible for all.

💼 For the past two years I've worked at cxpartners as a junior web developer, collaborating with ux consultants and senior developers.

🌱 Right now I'm looking for new opportunites as a front end developer and using my down time to upskill.

✨ I'm currently building my personal website using Astro and TailwindCSS.
